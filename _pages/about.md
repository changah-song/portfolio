### Paul Song: App-Building Enthusiast and ML Learner
**Skills**: Python, Javascript, React Native, Git, SQLite, Tensorflow, and more.

Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a AI & CS major graduate (2023) from Minerva University. 

I enjoy cleaning, analyzing, and gaining meaningful insights from data, building and teaching myself new machine learning models, and creating mini-apps that I think would make my life a tiny bit easier. Here's to being overwhelmed with the sheer amount of information available on the internet and trying to learn new things as often as possible. 

I am passionate about accessible knowledge and firmly believe that there is no knowledge unobtainable to anyone, there's just the right way to deliver it. I also believe that those given the privilege to receive said education are responsible to use it in a way that betters our society. Given this, I'm excited to start my career outside of internships and classroom settings and apply everything I've learned in a real-world setting to make a positive impact.

I've worn many different hats throughout the years as a Data Analyst, Software Engineer, CS Tutor, and Machine Learning blogger and have found that I enjoy all these for many different reasons and know that whatever hat I wear next, I will enjoy it thoroughly and give it my all.

I have an interest in continuous learning in life and never getting too comfortable sitting in one place. 

Through my university education, hands-on projects, and several internship experiences, Iâ€™ve learned a lot and am ready to start my career as a software engineer. Iâ€™ve learned both hard and soft skills working with people from 40+ different countries and across time zones.

The first job I held was a teaching job and throughout my university years and afterward, Iâ€™ve taught everyone from elementary students to high school students hoping to study abroad. Through this valuable experience, Iâ€™ve truly experienced how much education impacts people and how much potential it can plant in everyone.

Learning is empowering and knowledge is accessible these days. My long-term goal is to empower as many people as I can through accessible education and I hope that my skills can be used for such a purpose. 

Iâ€™ve written a blog series on Recommender Systems grounded on my educational background in Machine Learning and Deep Learning and created a mobile app to make learning Korean easier. These are both based on my belief and love for education.
